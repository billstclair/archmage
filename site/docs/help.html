<h3>Game Play</h3>

<p>To begin a game, focus your attention below the board. Check the "remote" box if you want to play this game through the server at GibGoyGames.com. Otherwise the game will be local and you will play both players on your computer. Click the "public" box, if you want the game to be listed on the "Public" page. If you want the other player to know who you are, other than just "White", enter "Your name". Then click the "New Game" button. If you chose a "public" game, the other player will be able to join on the "Public" page. Otherwise, you'll have to communicate the "Game ID" somehow (usually via text or chat).</p>

<p>To join a game started by someone else, either go to the "Public" page, fill in "Your name", and click on the "Join" button next to the other player's name, or, on the main page, fill in "Your name", paste the "Game ID" from the other player, and click "Join Game".</p>

<p>The game starts in setup mode. White's pieces are in the row above the main board, black's below. Each player clicks a piece to select it (the first piece is selected by default, but you don't have to use it), then clicks in an empty square in the board to place it.</p>

<p>When all fourteen pieces have been placed, white takes the first turn.</p>

<p>The potential actors are highlighted in green. Click on one of them to select it.</p>

<p>With an actor selected, the potential subjects are highlighted in blue. Click one to select it, or click on the actor to unselect it and select another.</p>

<p>With a subject selected, all the potential target locations are highlighted in red. The center hole will be highlighted in red if a piece it to be pushed or pulled there or pushed off the board. Click a target location to move the subject piece there and change the color of the actor.</p>

<p>When a piece is captured (moved off the board or into the center hole by clicking on the red-highlighted center hole), a black piece will move to the white player's capture area at the top, or a white piece will move to the black player's capture area at the bottom.</p>

<p>Your turn is over when you click the "End Turn" button, which is disabled during the first move of a turn or when in a Ko position. You may click "Undo" any time it's enabled to undo the previous move.</p>

<p>When no more moves are possible, or it is not possible to get into a non-Ko position, the game is over. Click the "New Game" button below the board to start a new game.</p>

<p>The game will automatically detect when both players either have no move or every move results in a Ko position. The message area will then say "Game Over!".

<p>If you hover the mouse over a piece, a pop-up tooltip will tell you its name and how it acts.</p>

<p>Below the "New Game" button is a text area that is filled in during play with a textual encoding of the board position. If you save this, then later, right after clicking "New Game", you can paste the saved string back here and press the "Restore" button to return to the earlier position.</p>
