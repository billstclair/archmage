<h3>Game Play</h3>

<p>The game starts in setup mode. White's pieces are in the row above the main board, black's below. Each player clicks a piece to select it (the first piece is selected by default, but you don't have to use it), then clicks in an empty square in the baord to place it.</p>

<p>When all fourteen pieces have been places, white takes the first turn.</p>

<p>The potential actors are highlighted in green. Click on one of them to select it. For other than your first move, the center hole will be outlined in orange. Click on it to end your turn.</p>

<p>With an actor selected, the potential subjects are highlighted in blue. Click one to select it, or click on the actor to unselect it and select another.</p>

<p>With a subject selected, all the potential target locations are highlighted in red. The center hole will be highlighted in red if a piece it to be pushed or pulled there or pushed off the board. Click a target location to move the subject piece there and change the color of the actor.</p>

<p>When a piece is captured (moved to the center hole by clicking there), a black piece will move to the white player's capture area at the top, or a white piece will move to the black player's capture area at the bottom.</p>

<p>When no more moves are possible, the game is over. Refresh the screen to start another.</p>
